About
=====

`Nikhil Marathe <https://nikhilism.com>`_ started writing this book one
afternoon (June 16, 2012) when he didn't feel like programming. He had recently
been stung by the lack of good documentation on libuv while working on
`node-taglib <https://github.com/nikhilm/node-taglib>`_. Although reference
documentation was present, there were no comprehensive tutorials. This book is
the output of that need and tries to be accurate. That said, the book may have
mistakes. Pull requests are encouraged.

Nikhil is indebted to Marc Lehmann's comprehensive `man page
<http://pod.tst.eu/http://cvs.schmorp.de/libev/ev.pod>`_ about libev which
describes much of the semantics of the two libraries.

This book was made using `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_ and `vim
<https://www.vim.org>`_.

.. note::
    In 2017 the libuv project incorporated the Nikhil's work into the official
    documentation and it's maintained there henceforth.
