.SH NAME
io_uring_register \- register files or user buffers for asynchronous I/O 
.SH SYNOPSIS

.BR "#include <linux/io_uring.h>"

.BI "                      void *" arg ", unsigned int " nr_args );

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP

The
.BR io_uring_register ()
system call registers user buffers or files for use in an
.BR io_uring (7)
instance referenced by
.IR fd .
Registering files or user buffers allows the kernel to take long term
references to internal data structures or create long term mappings of
application memory, greatly reducing per-I/O overhead.

.I fd
is the file descriptor returned by a call to
.BR io_uring_setup (2).
.I opcode
can be one of:

.TP
.B IORING_REGISTER_BUFFERS
.I arg
points to a
.I struct iovec
array of
.I nr_args
entries.  The buffers associated with the iovecs will be locked in
memory and charged against the user's
.B RLIMIT_MEMLOCK
resource limit.  See
.BR getrlimit (2)
for more information.  Additionally, there is a size limit of 1GiB per
buffer.  Currently, the buffers must be anonymous, non-file-backed
memory, such as that returned by
.BR malloc (3)
or
.BR mmap (2)
with the
.B MAP_ANONYMOUS
flag set.  It is expected that this limitation will be lifted in the
future. Huge pages are supported as well. Note that the entire huge
page will be pinned in the kernel, even if only a portion of it is
used.

After a successful call, the supplied buffers are mapped into the
kernel and eligible for I/O.  To make use of them, the application
must specify the
.B IORING_OP_READ_FIXED
or
.B IORING_OP_WRITE_FIXED
opcodes in the submission queue entry (see the
.I struct io_uring_sqe
definition in
.BR io_uring_enter (2)),
and set the
.I buf_index
field to the desired buffer index.  The memory range described by the
submission queue entry's
.I addr
and
.I len
fields must fall within the indexed buffer.

It is perfectly valid to setup a large buffer and then only use part
of it for an I/O, as long as the range is within the originally mapped
region.

An application can increase or decrease the size or number of
registered buffers by first unregistering the existing buffers, and
then issuing a new call to
.BR io_uring_register ()
with the new buffers.

Note that registering buffers will wait for the ring to idle. If the application
currently has requests in-flight, the registration will wait for those to
finish before proceeding.

An application need not unregister buffers explicitly before shutting
down the io_uring instance. Available since 5.1.

.TP
.B IORING_UNREGISTER_BUFFERS
This operation takes no argument, and
.I arg
must be passed as NULL.  All previously registered buffers associated
with the io_uring instance will be released. Available since 5.1.

.TP
.B IORING_REGISTER_FILES
Register files for I/O.
.I arg
contains a pointer to an array of
.I nr_args
file descriptors (signed 32 bit integers).

To make use of the registered files, the
.B IOSQE_FIXED_FILE
flag must be set in the
.I flags
member of the
.IR "struct io_uring_sqe" ,
and the
.I fd
member is set to the index of the file in the file descriptor array.

The file set may be sparse, meaning that the
.B fd
field in the array may be set to
.B -1.
See
.B IORING_REGISTER_FILES_UPDATE
for how to update files in place.

Note that registering files will wait for the ring to idle. If the application
currently has requests in-flight, the registration will wait for those to
finish before proceeding. See
.B IORING_REGISTER_FILES_UPDATE
for how to update an existing set without that limitation.

Files are automatically unregistered when the io_uring instance is
torn down. An application need only unregister if it wishes to
register a new set of fds. Available since 5.1.

.TP
.B IORING_REGISTER_FILES_UPDATE
This operation replaces existing files in the registered file set with new
ones, either turning a sparse entry (one where fd is equal to -1) into a
real one, removing an existing entry (new one is set to -1), or replacing
an existing entry with a new existing entry.
.I arg
must contain a pointer to a struct io_uring_files_update, which contains
an offset on which to start the update, and an array of file descriptors to
use for the update.
.I nr_args
must contain the number of descriptors in the passed in array. Available
since 5.5.

.TP
.B IORING_UNREGISTER_FILES
This operation requires no argument, and
.I arg
must be passed as NULL.  All previously registered files associated
with the io_uring instance will be unregistered. Available since 5.1.

.TP
.B IORING_REGISTER_EVENTFD
It's possible to use eventfd(2) to get notified of completion events on an
io_uring instance. If this is desired, an eventfd file descriptor can be
registered through this operation.
.I arg
must contain a pointer to the eventfd file descriptor, and
.I nr_args
must be 1. Available since 5.2.

An application can temporarily disable notifications, coming through the
registered eventfd, by setting the
.B IORING_CQ_EVENTFD_DISABLED
bit in the
.I flags
field of the CQ ring.
Available since 5.8.

.TP
.B IORING_REGISTER_EVENTFD_ASYNC
This works just like
.B IORING_REGISTER_EVENTFD
, except notifications are only posted for events that complete in an async
manner. This means that events that complete inline while being submitted
do not trigger a notification event. The arguments supplied are the same as
for
.B IORING_REGISTER_EVENTFD.
Available since 5.6.

.TP
.B IORING_UNREGISTER_EVENTFD
Unregister an eventfd file descriptor to stop notifications. Since only one
eventfd descriptor is currently supported, this operation takes no argument,
and
.I arg
must be passed as NULL and
.I nr_args
must be zero. Available since 5.2.

.TP
.B IORING_REGISTER_PROBE
This operation returns a structure, io_uring_probe, which contains information
about the opcodes supported by io_uring on the running kernel.
.I arg
must contain a pointer to a struct io_uring_probe, and
.I nr_args
must contain the size of the ops array in that probe struct. The ops array
is of the type io_uring_probe_op, which holds the value of the opcode and
a flags field. If the flags field has
.B IO_URING_OP_SUPPORTED
set, then this opcode is supported on the running kernel. Available since 5.6.

.TP
.B IORING_REGISTER_PERSONALITY
This operation registers credentials of the running application with io_uring,
and returns an id associated with these credentials. Applications wishing to
share a ring between separate users/processes can pass in this credential id
in the sqe
.B personality
field. If set, that particular sqe will be issued with these credentials. Must
be invoked with
.I arg
set to NULL and
.I nr_args
set to zero. Available since 5.6.

.TP
.B IORING_UNREGISTER_PERSONALITY
This operation unregisters a previously registered personality with io_uring.
.I nr_args
must be set to the id in question, and
.I arg
must be set to NULL. Available since 5.6.

.SH RETURN VALUE

On success,
.BR io_uring_register ()
returns 0.  On error, -1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set accordingly.

.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EBADF
One or more fds in the
.I fd
array are invalid.
.TP

.B IORING_REGISTER_BUFFERS
was specified, but
.I nr_args
exceeds
.B UIO_MAXIOV
.TP
.B EINVAL

.B IORING_REGISTER_FILES
was specified and
.I nr_args
exceeds the maximum allowed number of files in a fixed file set.
.TP
.B EMFILE
.B IORING_REGISTER_FILES
was specified and adding
.I nr_args
file references would exceed the maximum allowed number of files the user
is allowed to have according to the

permitted.  This limit is not enforced if the process is privileged
.RB ( CAP_IPC_LOCK ).
